# Linux-Graphics-Full-Stack

Hi There, 

Here I am showing how to get and build the major Linux graphics software components. If you've wondered and wanted know more about mordern graphics software stack, you've come to the right place. :) Along the way, hopefully I can throw some deep details on modern graphics technologies, which are normally hard to come by.  I use mostly Ubuntu so these are based on Ubuntu packages. I am using Intel Nuc with Kaby Lake for the hardware. Enjoy!
